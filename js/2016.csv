5,Features: Single-subject project,Simone Biles: The Fine Line,The New York Times,http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/05/sports/olympics-gymnast-simone-biles.html,Gold Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/best-of-digital-first-gold-awarded/,"Fabulous. Everything came together so well and it’s a great interaction with video. The experience of video and interactive can sometimes be really cumbersome but this really nails it. The flow of the story, the use of the graphics and video are spot-on; but also, the piece had the detail and narrative to pull the reader in. It’s not only a technical graphic, it’s telling you a complete story. The editing of the video was very consumable. The typography doesn’t get in the way and allows the reader to focus on the story. Plus, it’s just gorgeous on the phone."
5,Features: Single-subject project,"Blue Feed, Red Feed",Wall Street Journal,http://graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed/,Gold Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/best-of-digital-wall-street-journal-wins-gold-for-election-feed/,"The Wall Street Journal blew our mind in how brilliantly simple this piece was. It’s an important story told in a perfect way. People talk about political bubbles conceptually, but they actually went out and made it into something that shows it exists. The piece provides utility and continues to do its job after the election. The design isn’t mindblowing, but it doesn’t need to be. However, the powerful simplicity of the idea is mindblowing. No tricks, no gimmicks, no videos, no maps. It’s something that’s in front of us that’s juxtaposed. Every time we look at it, we think, “That’s it. That’s the future."
6,Features: Coverage,Concrete Divisions,Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/world/border-barriers/us-mexico-border-crossing/,Gold Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/best-of-digital-to-the-washington-post-for-exploring-the-wall/,"Tour de force. It’s thoughtful, immersive and deliberate with the navigation and all of the little touches. You’re building a wall as you go along. The Post pushes the medium forward in terms of trying to crack the nut on digital video storytelling with this piece. The maps are gorgeous and the control of just three colors is amazing. Not only does it stretch the medium of digital storytelling, but it also stretches the technical area. They seam together the video clips perfectly and provide a great user experience. You fall in and start going."
9,Graphics: Motion graphics,A Bullet Could Hit Me and My Kids Anytime',The New York Times,http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/28/us/chicago-violence-walking-to-school-a-bullet-could-hit-me-and-my-kids-anytime.html,Gold Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/best-of-digital-gold-to-the-new-york-times/,"This piece goes beyond the motion graphics category; it’s a marriage of multiple elements that tell the story in a standard-setting, exemplary way. It connects data to a specific person or specific perspective of a people. You see what is going to happen to them and then you see a broader view, which is no easy feat. It’s better than just thinking of this topic as points on a map. The Times thought of something that not everyone would think of doing and does it well. This is perfection of the use of data visualization in motion graphics."
12,Special events: 2016 Summer Olympic Games,Simone Biles: The Fine Line,The New York Times,http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/05/sports/olympics-gymnast-simone-biles.html,Gold Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/best-of-digital-first-gold-awarded/,"Fabulous. Everything came together so well and it’s a great interaction with video. The experience of video and interactive can sometimes be really cumbersome but this really nails it. The flow of the story, the use of the graphics and video are spot-on; but also, the piece had the detail and narrative to pull the reader in. It’s not only a technical graphic, it’s telling you a complete story. The editing of the video was very consumable. The typography doesn’t get in the way and allows the reader to focus on the story.

2,Breaking/Daily News: Single-subject project,"A Trail of Terror in Nice, Block by Block",The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/07/14/world/europe/trail-of-terror-france.html,Silver Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/best-of-digital-first-silver-medal-announced/,"A creative way to handle a breaking news event that’s not like the typical stack. It’s outstanding, close to being seamless. It worked really well on mobile. They used the right mechanisms to tell this story, it’s the right amount of information. Editing is a real-key to a high level story. Delivering one map and fact makes it delivered in palatable bite-size chunks. Almost-perfect turnaround for the story they’re trying to tell."
3,Breaking/Daily News: Planned coverage,Berlin City Marathon 2016,Morgen Post,http://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/berlin-marathon-2016/,Silver Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/best-of-digital-silver-to-berliner-morgenpost-for-marathon/,The simplicity of the graphic’s execution is its hallmark. It would have been easy to go over the top with annotation and explanation. The graphic was dialed in and fun and wasn’t oversubscribed. They took marathon results and created a novel visualization that offered a lot of different ways to experience and perceive the race.
5,Features: Single-subject project,NYT Magazine: The New York Issue,The New York Times,http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/06/05/magazine/new-york-life.html,Silver Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/best-of-digital-silver-to-the-n-y-times-magazine-for-your-issue/,"The way that they parsed out a single-topic issue was interesting. The mobile presentation is really thoughtful. The collection of current and historical information is good and everything has a consistent look, something not easy to do when pulling together so many types of media."
5,Features: Single-subject project,Under Our Skin: Talk About Race,Seattle Times,https://projects.seattletimes.com/2016/under-our-skin/,Silver Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/best-of-digital-silver-to-seattle-times-for-leading-a-discussion-on-race/,"You have the video — but you have a way to curate through the tags the kind of video. Instead of curating words, you’re curating video. It feels like a conversation, not just a singular piece. It brings a new kind of experience to the storytelling. The navigation is done brilliantly, which makes the reader want to stay with the piece longer. The comments, both where they are in the sequence and the fact that it’s brave to include, is necessary and well-done. Trying to design video experiences is a tall order — this is done well."
5,Features: Single-subject project,They Are Slaughtering Us Like Animals,The New York Times,http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/07/world/asia/rodrigo-duterte-philippines-drugs-killings.html,Silver Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/best-of-digital-silver-to-new-york-times-for-philippines-photo-story/,"For one, it’s great that they pull in Google Maps. I was kind of surprised by that choice — because they do so much mapping — but nobody can provide what that area looks like in the daytime quite the way Google can. The fact that you see the title and the option to see the caption lets the photos speak. The piece has very controlled use of the storytelling elements — photo, video and map."
5,Features: Single-subject project,Poems in Motion,Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/entertainment/national-poetry-month-poem-readings-2016/,Silver Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/silver-to-washington-post-for-10-poems-10-designs/,"The art direction really stands out. The navigation and UI make for a really clean experience. The visuals give a voice to the poems and story. It’s also novel — it’s something that we haven’t seen anywhere and stands apart. It’s not like every other digital experience. It’s clear that choices were made in the tone and feeling of the overall piece. Plus, the art matched the poems."
5,Features: Single-subject project,A Marine's Convictions,Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/local/marine/,Silver Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/best-of-digital-silver-to-washington-post-for-marine-profile/,"It’s a challenge to chapterize, and the left nav and unusual audio indicator made for a unique experience. It’s not necessarily pushing the boundaries of editorial design but it certainly is an adventure in product design, specifically in the read indicator and the ‘Save My Spot’ button. The animation of elements appearing added emphasis. There’s innovation in the wayfinding and in how the reader is going to experience this story."
5,Features: Single-subject project,A Bear's-Eye View of Yellowstone,National Geographic,http://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/05/yellowstone-national-parks-bears-video/,Silver Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/best-of-digital/,"What sets this piece apart from being just a graphics entry is its entry point to the story. It’s really consistent in style and links together many media types in a way that doesn’t feel disjointed. There’s a process and it’s compelling. I wanted to move through it. There’s clear art direction. It breaks out of the mold of what most people are doing. The mobile experience, too, was very good."
5,Features: Single-subject project,Arresting Words,Boston Globe,http://apps.bostonglobe.com/graphics/2016/04/arresting-words/,Silver Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/best-of-digital-silver-to-boston-globe/,"This piece had more ‘meat’ to it. It’s a more complex story, for sure, but they weren’t afraid to let the words be the story. We aren’t cramming videos and photos or a background map. The words became the imagery. There were a lot of interesting design choices, and the use of white space let the typography stand out. It’s smart, navigable and the boldness serves several purposes"
6,Features: Coverage,The Global Tech Issue,Bloomberg,https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-global-tech-inventors/,Silver Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/best-of-digital-silver-to-bloombergs-inventions-issue/,"It is unlike anything else we looked at. People could really hate this. They understood that and went for it anyway. It wasn’t halfway done or a halfway gimmick. They went all in and created a personalized experience and dashboard in a playful way. The piece is having a dialogue with a reader and it’s feeding you the experience. It’s so bold and out there, it’s totally rad. It works to be different in a sea where everything looks the same."
7,Graphics: Breaking news,Inside the Orlando Night Club,The New York Times,http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/06/12/us/what-happened-at-the-orlando-nightclub-shooting.html,Silver Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/37791/,"The presentation is really solid and the reporting was done extremely well. This piece sets the standard of what we should expect from breaking news visual stories. The format that they chose was perfect for adding new information and visual bites. It’s very tightly edited — the multimedia elements are where they need to be. As a standards-setting piece, it’s beyond excellent. The decision to do a 3D model and annotation is nothing new, but the execution of this piece was done elegantly. The reader doesn’t have to “work” to understand the breaking news. In breaking news, this is an exceptional job."
8,Graphics: Features and planned coverage,The Two Americas of 2016,The New York Times,http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/16/us/politics/the-two-americas-of-2016.html,Silver Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/best-of-digital-silver-to-nyt-for-the-two-americas/,"It’s a creative way of doing the thing everyone was talking about. It was a form unseen before in order to make information more clear. There isn’t another way to do it that’s simple, compelling, and hilarious."
8,Graphics: Features and planned coverage,Memoria Robada (Stolen Memory),La Nacion,http://www.nacion.com/gnfactory/investigacion/2016/memoria-robada/,Silver Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/best-of-digital-la-nacion-wins-silver-for-stolen-memory/,Exquisitely done and an interesting topic. The fact that they chose to drive most of the storytelling of an investigation through graphics is very well-executed. There’s something to be said for having the audacity to present this kind of story this way. The graphics are very well edited and show only what they need to. This piece is more chiseled than other pieces and the simplicity makes it stand out.
8,Graphics: Features and planned coverage,Rewind the Red Planet,National Geographic,http://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2016/11/exploring-mars-map-panorama-pictures/,Silver Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/best-of-digital-silver-to-national-geographic-for-mars-piece/,"It’s a very simple presentation, then it goes into an absolutely gorgeous panorama. Moving to a panorama isn’t an easy thing and they did it fluidly. The narrative they’ve built is super simple, clear and consistent. It’s hard to do time and space together and not feel like you have whiplash. Usually you have to choose, and they’ve done both. Beautiful and educational."
8,Graphics: Features and planned coverage,How Does Hamilton Blur Musical Lines?,Wall Street Journal,http://graphics.wsj.com/hamilton/,Silver Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/best-of-digital-silver-to-wall-street-journal-for-hamilton/,"Visualizing sound is tricky but they did it “enormously well.” It’s current, fun, both think-y and quirky. Often audio is ‘listen to audio as you look at something’, but this was audio as data."
9,Graphics: Motion graphics,Mariah Carey,Vice News,https://vimeo.com/202297501/7e3ba77715,Silver Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/best-of-digital-silver-to-vice-for-a-mariah-carey-song-analysis/,"VICE put in a lot of fun data in terms of the structure of this music, which you don’t see in a lot of motion graphics. Their script is incredibly well written and their breakdown of the song is just perfect. It was effective and playful. This is an excellent example of what motion graphics can do and be."
11,Special events: U.S. elections,Washington Post Election Coverage,Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/election-results-from-coast-to-coast/,Silver Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/best-of-digital-silver-to-washington-post-for-election-coverage/,"This is tight editing of a portfolio for an election. These pieces have a deep engagement factor. They push the envelope and invite you to think and engage. Audience engagement is the reason we have jobs today. They consistently do that well. Part of what sets their work apart is in how they handle scaling. Some sites can overscale or bloat on desktop, but The Post’s visualizations and design take advantage of big screen. They show a lot of creativity and analytical thinking in these pieces."
11,Special events: U.S. elections,Guardian Election Coverage,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/nov/08/us-election-2016-results-live-clinton-trump,Silver Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/best-of-digital-silver-to-the-guardian-for-vr-prison-project/,"It’s using the VR characteristic of putting you in the place, but the audio and experiences that happen help tell the story like none other we’ve seen. The piece was emotional, and the fact that limited interactivity is available with VR made it the perfect storytelling platform for being confined in a space. The story is journalistically sound and has more merit because of the virtual reality platform. Unlike a lot of VR, it has a very strong narrative."
12,Special events: 2016 Summer Olympic Games,Decisive Moments,The New York Times,http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/20/sports/olympics/decisive-moments-rio-olympics-composite-pictures.html,Silver Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/best-of-digital-silver-for-new-york-times-for-olympic-moments/,"There’s artistry and movement, beautifully executed. Like an infographic in photos, moments captured carefully and in motion. It’s accessible and consumable and breaks down precise split second moments down for more careful consideration."
12,Special events: 2016 Summer Olympic Games,Usain Bolt,The New York Times,http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/15/sports/olympics/usain-bolt-mens-100-meters-final.html,Silver Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/best-of-digital-silver-to-new-york-times-for-usain-bolt-race-breakdown/,"We’ve seen a lot of panoramics and this is a good example of how to do it well, and the reporting is outstanding. To take something that happens in 9 seconds and turn it into this is fascinating and it freezes time. It works because the race is short, not 200m. It’s perfect, precise."
12,Special events: 2016 Summer Olympic Games,Post Olympics WaPo,Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/sports/olympics/scale-of-the-olympics/,Silver Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/best-of-digital-silver-to-washington-post-for-overall-olympics-coverage/,"Playful and consistent. It made me smile. It made me laugh. And that’s part of the experience. You can mouse over anything and it fills with color or movement, it’s a lot of fun. Great and unique comparisons to things like pizza boxes or Boeing. Scale and angle is interesting but it works, it feels relatively seamless. The simplicity of the illustrations is consistent and effective to explain the concepts. Medals is a new take on the usual chart, but very simple and good. It’s outside normal Olympics coverage, more whimsical and imaginative to deal with data (i.e., how many medals win). It surprises you with the approach. Brilliant."
13,Special events: Refugee crisis,Refugee Coverage,Washington Post,http://digital.snd.org/2017/01/27/39469/washington-post-refugee-coverage/,Silver Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/best-of-digital-washington-post-refugee/,"It’s well done, it’s ambitious. The pieces are all long — more like a short documentary than a single experience. The journey that the refugees are taking, though, is long and arduous. This storytelling reflects that. We are used to long scroll experiences in the vertical format, but it’s unusual to see that with video and photo pieces. When you see this, you feel like you are inside. That’s truly the difference between print and digital. When you hear and see people talking, that’s what makes digital stories so powerful and why this uniform piece works so well."
16,Portfolio: Organization,The New York Times,The New York Times,http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/07/world/asia/rodrigo-duterte-philippines-drugs-killings.html,Silver Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/best-of-digital-silver-to-new-york-times-for-organization-portfolio/,The body of work is incredibly impressive. The attention to detail and how consistently well edited everything is shows. Each piece on its own was solid and unique. There was a consistent visual editing hand even though they were from different people and different pieces. The Times’ portfolio shows the true breadth of well-executed products. No entry was redundant. They excel in every medium.
16,Portfolio: Organization,Washington Post,Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/world/border-barriers/global-illegal-immigration-prevention/,Silver Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/best-of-digital-silver-to-washington-post-for-organization-portfolio/,"The Post shows consistency throughout its portfolio both in the range visualization techniques and range of form, as seen by pieces like “Raising Barriers” and “Six maps that show that anatomy of the American infrastructure”. For a portfolio, that’s what you want to see. They thought of mobile and desktop as two separate platforms. They didn’t execute the same ideas from desktop on mobile or vice versa. They don’t overengineer these pieces. They find the right way to tell the story."
18,Product Design,Watching,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/watching,Silver Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/best-of-digital-silver-to-new-york-times-for-watching-product-design/,"This is very functional, works amazing and is well designed. Compared to the other product services news organization did this year, they really give the user what they want. It does the job of answering what, where and how to watch."
18,Product Design,Washington Post PWA app,Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/pwa/,Silver Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/best-of-digital-silver-to-washington-post-for-its-progressive-web-app/,"PWA is trailblazing and works well. We don’t know of anything else that compares to it to this extent. The fact it has offline capacity is very user-friendly. It’s the first of its kind, isn’t buggy and doesn’t frustrate you. It takes a lot of technical work to get it to that level of perfection."
19,Experimental Design,6x9: A VR Experience of Solitary Confinement,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2016/apr/27/6x9-a-virtual-experience-of-solitary-confinement,Silver Medal,https://www.snd.org/2017/02/best-of-digital-silver-to-the-guardian-for-vr-prison-project/,"It’s using the VR characteristic of putting you in the place, but the audio and experiences that happen help tell the story like none other we’ve seen. The piece was emotional, and the fact that limited interactivity is available with VR made it the perfect storytelling platform for being confined in a space. The story is journalistically sound and has more merit because of the virtual reality platform. Unlike a lot of VR, it has a very strong narrative."
1,World's Best,The Outline,The Outline,https://theoutline.com/,World's Best,https://www.snd.org/2017/07/snd-digital-worlds-best-the-outline/,"Instead of complaining that platforms like Facebook and Snapchat are strong in mobile, they set out to learn from them and created their own mobile storytelling formats. The Outline does not play it safe. They made bold decisions, broke all the rules and created a truly mobile-first experience that’s delightful and different. We applaud them for their audaciousness."
